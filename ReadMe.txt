READ ME for MoritzHerle/Indentifiying-typical-trajectories-in-longitudinal-data

This repository holds code associated with the publication titled: "Identifying typical trajectories in longitudinal data: modelling strategies and interpretations" (DOI: XXX-XXX). 
All code written by Moritz Herle and Bianca De Stavola. 
This publication is part of a grant led by Nadia Micali funded by the UK Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Foundation (ref: MR/R004803/1)
Analyses for this project were conducted in MPLUS (Version 8.1). 
****************************
This repository includes the following example Mplus and Stata scripts to estimate: 

1. Three types of latent trajectory models:

     a) GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: GrowhtMixtureModel.txt

     b) LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS: LatentClassGrowthAnalysis.txt

     c) LONGITUDINAL LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS: LongitudinalLatentClassAnalysis.txt

2. Models that relate an explanatory variable to latent trajectory classes using:

     a) 1-step approach for a GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: LBMI_GMM4_onBW_1step.txt

     b) 3-steps approach for a GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: LBMI_GMM4_onBW_3steps.txt
     
     c) 1-step approach for a LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS MODEL: LBMI_LCGA5_onBW_1step.txt

     d) 3-steps approach for a LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS MODEL: LBMI_LCGA5_onBW_3steps.txt

3. Models that relate latent trajectory classes to an outcome using:

     a) 1-step approach for a GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: LBMI_GMM4_onY_1step.txt

     b) 3-steps approach for a GROWTH MIXTURE MODEL: LBMI_GMM4_onY_3steps.txt
     
     c) 1-step approach for a LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS MODEL: LBMI_LCGA5_onY_1step.txt

     d) 3-steps approach for a LATENT CLASS GROWTH ANALYSIS MODEL: LBMI_LCGA5_onY_3steps.txt

4. Stata scripts 

5. Example code to estimate Growth mixture models and latent class growth analyses in R using lcmm package
